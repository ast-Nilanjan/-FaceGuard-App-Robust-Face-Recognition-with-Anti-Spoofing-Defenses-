🚀 Project Overview


FaceGuard-App is a robust face authentication system designed to secure identity verification through two layers of defense:
Face Anti-Spoofing: Detects whether the face presented is real (live) or fake (photo, video replay, etc.).
Face Detection and Recognition: Accurately detects and verifies a real face using YOLOv11-Face and DeepFace.
This ensures that only genuine, live faces are authenticated and matched against the authorized database.



🛡️ Key Features


Anti-Spoofing Defense: Classifies live captures into Real or Fake using a trained Anti-Spoofing model.
Accurate Face Detection: Detects faces using a custom-tuned YOLOv11-Face detector.
Deep Face Recognition: Recognizes and matches detected real faces using the DeepFace library.
Streamlit UI Integration: User-friendly web app that captures webcam input and performs full authentication workflow in real time. 
Secure Authentication Flow: Only if the face is real and recognized, login is successful.




🏗️ How It Works


Capture: Webcam feed captures live frames.
Anti-Spoofing Check: The frame is passed to the Anti-Spoofing module.
If the face is classified as Fake, authentication is immediately denied.
If Real, proceed to the next step.
Face Detection (YOLOv11-Face): Detects faces accurately in the frame.
Face Recognition (DeepFace): Matches the detected real face against the stored known faces dataset.
Authentication: If matched, the user is logged in. 
If not matched, access is denied.




📁 Dataset


Real Faces: Captured from authorized users.
Fake Faces: Spoofed attacks using photos/videos.




✨ Future Improvements


Support for multi-face authentication.
Enhanced anti-spoofing using depth or motion analysis.
Mobile version of the app.
Better liveness detection methods (e.g., eye blink detection).

🔥 Stay Safe. Authenticate Smartly.

Would you also like me to prepare a badge header (like "Build Passing", "License MIT", etc.) or a small badge group for your README? 🚀
It can make it look even more professional! 🎯
(If yes, I can give you the markdown code too.)
